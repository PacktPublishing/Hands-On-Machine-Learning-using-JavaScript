## About the Video Course
Machine Learning is a growing and in-demand skill but until now JavaScript developers have not been able to take advantage of it due to the steep learning curve involved in learning a new language. This course shows you various machine learning techniques in a practical way and helps you implement them using the JavaScript language.
Hands-On Machine Learning using JavaScript gives you the opportunity to use the power of machine learning (without installing additional software on the customer's computer) and make them feel safe as the data resides in the system. This course covers basic as well as advanced topics in Machine Learning and gives a holistic picture of the JavaScript machine learning ecosystem by making use of libraries to design smarter applications. 
By the end of this course, you'll have gained hands-on experience in evaluating and implementing the right model using the power of JavaScript.
